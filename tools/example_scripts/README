This directory is a collection of scripts and "crontab" entries mostly
intended for automated testing.  These scripts are not intended for
casual users.  If you have any questions about them or would like help
writing one for your system, please contact Ed Hill <eh3@mit.edu>.

The naming convention is "$MACHINE_$INFO" where $MACHINE gives some
indication of where the script is supposed to run and $INFO gives some
idea of its purpose.
