This verification experiment is identical global_with_exf
except that it includes CFC-11 diagnostic as per OCMIP-2
protocol (http://www.ipsl.jussieu.fr/OCMIP/).
CFC-11 output in mol/m^3 is output in files TR1.*.data
Example of how to read this output file using matlab is
in input/lookat.m

Configuring and running the 50-year JPL telescoping integration:

1) get code:

setenv CVSROOT :pserver:cvsanon@mitgcm.org:/u/u0/gcmpack
cvs login ( CVS password: cvsanon )
cvs co -r release1_P15 MITgcm

2) compile code:

cd MITgcm/bin
cp ../verification/global_with_CFC11/code50yr/*.h .
cp ../verification/global_with_CFC11/code50yr/*.F .
cp ../verification/global_with_CFC11/code50yr/.genmakerc .
../tools/genmake -mpi -platform=o2k -makefile
make depend
make

3) run code for first spin-up year (1931)

cd ../exe

get forcing files:
Depth.data         NCEP_1948_sw       NCEP_1948_vstr     lev_clim_temp.bin
NCEP_1948_emp      NCEP_1948_trb      run-off.bin_1x1    lev_clim_salt.bin
NCEP_1948_sst      NCEP_1948_ustr     salt_14months.bin

cp ../verification/global_with_CFC11/input50yr/* .




wind stress and heat fluxes (incl radiation) are labeled by
NCEP as 0h,6h,12h, and 18h. However, they represent
averages over 0-6h,6-12h,12-18h, and 18-24h. 

air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed and
precipitation are labeled identically by NCEP but represent
instantaneous forecast values at 6h,12h,18h, and 24h.
