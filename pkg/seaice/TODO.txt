remove output of surface forcing files
they are redundant

more consistent integration with saltFlux/EmPmR
input variables in FFIELDS.h

push for unit consistency in FFIELDS.h
for oceanic convention, sign of saltFlux, Qnet, and Qsw
need to be reversed.

eventually move all code for reading files into pkg/exf


ask Alistair about multi-advection and advection schemes for 1/4-deg


maybe best is to compute surfacetendencyTice inside sea-ice packages,
but then apply these corrections inside thermodynamics in what was
formelly freeze.F
